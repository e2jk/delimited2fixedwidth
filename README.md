How to run the program
======================

How to install the program
--------------------------

For Windows, just download the latest version [here](https://github.com/e2jk/delimited2fixedwidth/releases/latest) and run it on your system, no need to install anything.

For other platforms, see the information outlined in the "How to install from source" section below.

(Compiled versions are only produced for Windows, as this project was originally developed to run in that environment, but the software is known to run on other platforms -- for example, the Continuous Integration runs on Ubuntu 20.04, and the developer actually devs on an Ubuntu machine)

Configuration file
------------------

In order for the program to know how to transform your delimited file into a fixed-width file, you will need to provide a configuration file describing the length and type of values expected for your output file.

An example configuration file can be found at
[`tests/sample_files/configuration1.xlsx`](../../tree/master/tests/sample_files/configuration1.xlsx)

A configuration file is a simple Excel `.xlsx` file in which each row represents a single field expected in the output file (the fixed-width file), and at least these 3 column headers, i.e. the first line in your Excel file:

* Length
* Output format
* Skip field

The **Length** value is self-explanatory: it represents how long the field will be in the generated fixed-width file. If the value in the input file is shorter than this defined length, it will be padded with `0`s or spaces, depending on the type of Output format (see next section).

The **Output format** defines how the input value must be treated and transformed. The following values are supported:
* Integer
  * A numeric value that gets padded with `0`s added to the left
  * Example: "`123`" becomes "`000123`" if a length of 6 is defined
* Decimal
  * Decimal numbers get sent as "cents" instead of "dollars", rounded to the nearest cent. (yeah, weird explanation -- better have a look at the example...). Also padded with `0`s added to the left.
  * Example: "`123.458`" becomes "`00012346`" if a length of 8 is defined
* Date (DD/MM/YYYY)
  * A date sent as input format "day/month/year" becomes (without spaces ) "year month day"
  * Example: "`21/06/2020`" becomes "`20200621`" if a length of 8 is defined
* Time
  A time sent as hour:minutes (with or without colon in the input data) will be sent out without the colon
  * Example: "`20:06`" becomes "`2006`" if a length of 4 is defined
* Text
  * The value gets sent without format changes (such as those outlined above for date and time), with spaces added at the end, on the right of the string
  * Example: "`Hello`" becomes "<code>Hello&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>" if a length of 10 is defined

Finally, setting the value of the **Skip field** column to "`True`" allows to send a field as blank in the output file, respecting the field size and padding type: `0`s or spaces depending on the defined output format.


Running the program
-------------------

Open a Command Line window `cmd` and indicate your input file name, output file name and configuration file to use. You can additionally indicate if your input file uses a specific field separator (default is `,`), textual field wrapper (default is `"`), or if you want to skip a specific number of header or footer files from your input file.

An example run of the program could look like this:

```
delimited2fixedwidth.exe --input data\input_file.txt --config data\configuration_file.xlsx --output data\output_file.txt --delimiter "^" --skip-header 1 --skip-footer 1
```

  -dl DELIMITER, --delimiter DELIMITER
                        The field delimiter used in the input file (default ,)
  -q QUOTECHAR, --quotechar QUOTECHAR
                        The character used to wrap textual fields in the input file (default ")
  -sh SKIP_HEADER, --skip-header SKIP_HEADER
                        The number of header lines to skip (default 0)
  -sf SKIP_FOOTER, --skip-footer SKIP_FOOTER
                        The number of footer lines to skip (default 0)

Development information
=======================

How to install from source
--------------------------

Setting up a Virtual Python environment and installing the dependencies is covered on the [`README_VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT`](../../tree/master/README_VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT.md) page.

Building the executable
-----------------------

Run the following command in your virtual environment:

  `$ pyinstaller --onefile delimited2fixedwidth.py`

The executable that gets created in the `dist` folder can then be uploaded to Github as a new release.

Packaging the source and publishing to the Python Package Index
---------------------------------------------------------------

Follow the instructions mentioned [here](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#generating-distribution-archives), namely:

```
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
python3 -m twine upload dist/*
```
